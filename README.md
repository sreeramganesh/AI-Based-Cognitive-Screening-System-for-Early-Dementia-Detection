##  Project Overview
The **AI-Based Cognitive Screening System** is a web-based application designed to assist in the early detection of dementia by analyzing speech characteristics, cognitive task performance, and behavioral response patterns. Dementia is a progressive neurological condition where early symptoms are often subtle and mistaken for normal aging, leading to delayed diagnosis. This project aims to address that gap by providing an accessible, affordable, and non-clinical screening solution using artificial intelligence.

The system evaluates factors such as speech pauses, word retrieval difficulty, memory, attention, decision-making ability, and response time. Machine learning models analyze these features to generate a personalized dementia risk score that can support early intervention and informed healthcare follow-up.

##  Objectives
- Detect early signs of cognitive decline using AI and machine learning  
- Provide a quick, non-invasive, and non-clinical screening method  
- Improve accessibility to cognitive screening for rural and urban communities  
- Support caregivers and healthcare professionals with preliminary risk assessment  
- Promote early awareness and proactive mental healthcare

##  Problem Statement
- Early dementia symptoms are subtle and often ignored  
- Clinical diagnosis is expensive and requires specialized facilities  
- Many individuals seek medical help only in later stages  
- Limited access to early screening tools in rural and underserved areas
